  abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to provide both application-oriented
	researchers and practitioners with detailed insights into conception,
	implementation, and utilization of intra-organizational wikis to
	support knowledge management and group work. Firstly, we report on
	three case studies and describe how wikis have been appropriated
	in the context of a concrete practice. Our study reveals that the
	wikis have been used as Knowledge Base, Encyclopedia and Support
	Base, respectively. We present the identified practices as a result
	of the wiki appropriation process and argue that due to their open
	and flexible nature these wikis have been appropriated according
	to the users' needs. Our contribution helps to understand how platforms
	support working practices that have not been supported by groupware
	before, or at least not in the same way. Secondly, three detailed
	implementation reports uncover many aspects of wiki projects, e.g.,
	different viewpoints of managers and users, an investigation of other
	sources containing business-relevant information, and perceived obstacles
	to wiki projects. In this context, our study generates a series of
	lessons learned for people who intend to implement wikis in their
	own organizations, including the awareness of usage potential, the
	need for additional managerial support, and clear communication strategies
	to promote wiki usage.}},
