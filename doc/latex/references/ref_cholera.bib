	Abstract = {{The connections of the lateral hypothalamic area juxtadorsomedial region
   (LHAjd) were investigated in a series of pathway-tracing experiments
   involving iontophoretic co-injection of the tracers Phaseolus
   vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L; for outputs) and cholera toxin B
   subunit (CTB; for inputs). Results revealed that the LHAjd has
   connections with some 318 distinct gray matter regions encompassing all
   four subsystemsmotor, sensory, cognitive, and behavioral stateincluded
   in a basic structurefunction network model of the nervous system.
   Integration of these subsystems is necessary for the coordination and
   control of emotion and behavior, and in that regard the connections of
   the LHAjd indicate that it may have a prominent role. Furthermore, the
   LHAjd connections, together with the connections of other LHA
   differentiations studied similarly to date, indicate a distinct
   topographic organization that suggests each LHA differentiation has
   specifically differing degrees of involvement in the control of multiple
   behaviors. For the LHAjd, its involvement to a high degree in the
   control of defensive behavior, and to a lesser degree in the control of
   other behaviors, including ingestive and reproductive, is suggested.
   Moreover, the connections of the LHAjd suggest that its possible role in
   the control of these behaviors may be very broad in scope because they
   involve the somatic, neuroendocrine, and autonomic divisions of the
   nervous system. In addition, we suggest that connections between LHA
   differentiations may provide, at the level of the hypothalamus, a
   neuronal substrate for the coordinated control of multiple themes in the
   behavioral repertoire. J. Comp. Neurol. 520:18311890, 2012. (c) 2012
