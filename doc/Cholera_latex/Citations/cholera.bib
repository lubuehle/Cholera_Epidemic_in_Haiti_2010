	Abstract = {{Background: Haiti is in the midst of a cholera epidemic. Surveillance
   data for formulating models of the epidemic are limited, but such models
   can aid understanding of epidemic processes and help define control
   strategies.
   Objective: To predict, by using a mathematical model, the sequence and
   timing of regional cholera epidemics in Haiti and explore the potential
   effects of disease-control strategies.
   Design: Compartmental mathematical model allowing person-to-person and
   waterborne transmission of cholera. Within-and between-region epidemic
   spread was modeled, with the latter dependent on population sizes and
   distance between regional centroids (a ``gravity{''} model).
   Setting: Haiti, 2010 to 2011.
   Data Sources: Haitian hospitalization data, 2009 census data,
   literature-derived parameter values, and model calibration.
   Measurements: Dates of epidemic onset and hospitalizations.
   Results: The plausible range for cholera's basic reproductive number
   (R(o), defined as the number of secondary cases per primary case in a
   susceptible population without intervention) was 2.06 to 2.78. The order
   and timing of regional cholera outbreaks predicted by the gravity model
   were closely correlated with empirical observations. Analysis of changes
   in disease dynamics over time suggests that public health interventions
   have substantially affected this epidemic. A limited vaccine supply
   provided late in the epidemic was projected to have a modest effect.
   Limitations: Assumptions were simplified, which was necessary for
   modeling. Projections are based on the initial dynamics of the epidemic,
   which may change.
   Conclusion: Despite limited surveillance data from the cholera epidemic
   in Haiti, a model simulating between-region disease transmission
   according to population and distance closely reproduces reported disease
   patterns. This model is a tool that planners, policy-makers, and medical
   personnel seeking to manage the epidemic could use immediately.}},

@article{tien:2010,
	Abstract = {{Multiple transmission pathways exist for many waterborne diseases,
   including cholera, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Campylobacter.
   Theoretical work exploring the effects of multiple transmission pathways
   on disease dynamics is incomplete. Here, we consider a simple ODE model
   that extends the classical SIR framework by adding a compartment (W)
   that tracks pathogen concentration in the water. Infected individuals
   shed pathogen into the water compartment, and new infections arise both
   through exposure to contaminated water, as well as by the classical SIR
   person-person transmission pathway. We compute the basic reproductive
   number (a{''}>(0)), epidemic growth rate, and final outbreak size for
   the resulting ``SIWR{''} model, and examine how these fundamental
   quantities depend upon the transmission parameters for the different
   pathways. We prove that the endemic disease equilibrium for the SIWR
   model is globally stable. We identify the pathogen decay rate in the
   water compartment as a key parameter determining when the distinction
   between the different transmission routes in the SIWR model is
   important. When the decay rate is slow, using an SIR model rather than
   the SIWR model can lead to under-estimates of the basic reproductive
   number and over-estimates of the infectious period.}},
