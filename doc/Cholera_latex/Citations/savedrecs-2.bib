Abstract = {{Multiple transmission pathways exist for many waterborne diseases,
   including cholera, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Campylobacter.
   Theoretical work exploring the effects of multiple transmission pathways
   on disease dynamics is incomplete. Here, we consider a simple ODE model
   that extends the classical SIR framework by adding a compartment (W)
   that tracks pathogen concentration in the water. Infected individuals
   shed pathogen into the water compartment, and new infections arise both
   through exposure to contaminated water, as well as by the classical SIR
   person-person transmission pathway. We compute the basic reproductive
   number (a{''}>(0)), epidemic growth rate, and final outbreak size for
   the resulting ``SIWR{''} model, and examine how these fundamental
   quantities depend upon the transmission parameters for the different
   pathways. We prove that the endemic disease equilibrium for the SIWR
   model is globally stable. We identify the pathogen decay rate in the
   water compartment as a key parameter determining when the distinction
   between the different transmission routes in the SIWR model is
   important. When the decay rate is slow, using an SIR model rather than
   the SIWR model can lead to under-estimates of the basic reproductive
   number and over-estimates of the infectious period.}},
