Abstract = {{Background: Haiti is in the midst of a cholera epidemic. Surveillance
   data for formulating models of the epidemic are limited, but such models
   can aid understanding of epidemic processes and help define control
   strategies.
   Objective: To predict, by using a mathematical model, the sequence and
   timing of regional cholera epidemics in Haiti and explore the potential
   effects of disease-control strategies.
   Design: Compartmental mathematical model allowing person-to-person and
   waterborne transmission of cholera. Within-and between-region epidemic
   spread was modeled, with the latter dependent on population sizes and
   distance between regional centroids (a ``gravity{''} model).
   Setting: Haiti, 2010 to 2011.
   Data Sources: Haitian hospitalization data, 2009 census data,
   literature-derived parameter values, and model calibration.
   Measurements: Dates of epidemic onset and hospitalizations.
   Results: The plausible range for cholera's basic reproductive number
   (R(o), defined as the number of secondary cases per primary case in a
   susceptible population without intervention) was 2.06 to 2.78. The order
   and timing of regional cholera outbreaks predicted by the gravity model
   were closely correlated with empirical observations. Analysis of changes
   in disease dynamics over time suggests that public health interventions
   have substantially affected this epidemic. A limited vaccine supply
   provided late in the epidemic was projected to have a modest effect.
   Limitations: Assumptions were simplified, which was necessary for
   modeling. Projections are based on the initial dynamics of the epidemic,
   which may change.
   Conclusion: Despite limited surveillance data from the cholera epidemic
   in Haiti, a model simulating between-region disease transmission
   according to population and distance closely reproduces reported disease
   patterns. This model is a tool that planners, policy-makers, and medical
   personnel seeking to manage the epidemic could use immediately.}},
